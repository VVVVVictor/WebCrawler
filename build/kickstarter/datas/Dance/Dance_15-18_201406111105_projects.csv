We still have a few days to go and can put dollars over our goal to good use - an extra camera person for the video shoot, gas for the truck to transport the floor, etc. Kickstarter will let you pledge over our goal!  For 25 years audiences have come to Ashland Oregon's historic and beautiful Lithia Park on cool summer evenings to watch live ballet performances by Ballet Rogue. Unfortunately, that company folded last year. So, Dancing People Company, Southern Oregon's premiere contemporary dance group, is stepping in to fill the void with Dance In The Park. DPC will perform in the Lithia Park Bandshell on July 23rd and 24th at 6PM, beginning a new tradition for local dance lovers and an extra treat for visitors to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Imagine bringing a picnic to beautiful Lithia Park (Ashland Creek burbling in the background, little girls dressed as fairies cavorting on the lawn before the performance) then settling in to watch a fine dance concert - athletic, evocative, witty, beautiful, and of course entertaining - all you could ask for in a dance performance. Our company of six professional dancers will showcase dances recently created by Artistic Director, Robin Stiehm, including ""Gritty Interval"" and ""An Uncommon Enchantment"". She will also create a new dance, especially for Dance In The Park. You can help make this possible for yourself and others to enjoy! We need to raise money for materials for a portable dance floor to lay over the concrete sub-floor (labor will be donated). This is essential to protect our dancers. We also need funds to rent a sound system, publicize the event and pay a little bit to our talented and dedicated artists. You may know one of them: Emily Abrahams, Will Cooper, Veronica DeWitt, Erin Drummond, Brianna Rae Johnson and Alonzo Lee Moore IV. Our dream is to build this project into a full dance festival, with dance artists from across the Pacific Northwest joining Dancing People. Along with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, we would add one more reason to visit beautiful Ashland in the summer. From humble beginnings, great things can happen, but we can't do it alone - please help this first year succeed.

We've been collaborating on a new project this past year, Hunger for the Longing (a biased history of seduction) inspired in part by Woody Guthrie's iconic (and misunderstood) song, This Land is Your Land. As dancers, actors, video artist, and musicians, we are finding ways to focus on the ideas of misplaced patriotism, inequality and seduction through movement, song, video and storytelling. We've performed the work in progress twice in NYC. We got a grant from Teatro Pubblico Pugliese to perform and teach. We need to supplement travel funds to get there!We are a collective of dancer/actors- Amy Chavasse, Aidan Feldman, Jessica Jolly, Sarah Konner, Donnell Oakley, Austin Selden and David Schmidt; musician/ composers- Jeremy Edwards, Jon Moniaci and Stephen Rush; and video artist- Caroline Chavasse. We all are independent artists and educators who have come together to collaborate on this project. Artistic Director, Amy Chavasse, submitted a proposal to Teatro Pubblico Pugliese in Bari for a residency to complete and premiere Hunger for the Longing, and the application was accepted. We will be housed in the studios of ResExtensa Danza Teatro Danza in Giovinazzo (just north of Bari) and will rehearse and teach throughout the week, premiering the new work on July 15. We'll then travel to Rome for an informal studio showing on the 16th.During our busy week in Italy, we'll teach community classes in contemporary technique, improvisation and music and dance collaborations. All of our rehearsals are open to the public. This is an amazing opportunity for an artistic and cultural exchange, in addition to a welcome opportunity to get together to rehearse, create and perform. We plan to continue performing the completed work in the U.S. in 2011-12.We have significant support from ResExtensa and Teatro Pubblico Pugliese, along with other funding sources but we need some additional money to contribute to air and train fare.Please support us! It's a great project.",0,,1,1,USD,51,4135.0,4000.0,0 seconds,2011-05-21,2011-06-15,25,Amy Chavasse,"Bari, Italy",NA,1528343229,246,2014-04-28,2010-10-13,25,1,0,0,22,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

First time to meet the world audience with his company in this evening long production, in such a prestigious venue, Basaran's work also carries a  manifesto character presenting his movement language and approach to dance..    The movement language of Basaran ranges from neo-classical to contemporary and contains an instinctive simplicity and emotional honesty that connects his work to a universal language of movement. The surprising choices the choreographer brings into the language, creates the risky yet inner focused and clarified movement brought out of the dancers which also brings a virtuosic challenge and perfection for the performer..    The performance consists of 3 episodes which are simply described as on Love, on Land and on Life.. The opening section ""on Love"" will bring the audience 2 duets from Basaran's works which were created and premiered in Istanbul, Turkey before moving to NY and have been performed by various amazing performers since then.. ""On Land"" is choreographed on traditional Turkish music performed by a great master of Turkish music which has been chosen from a wide range of cultural history.. This part of the evening is also a preview of a bigger production that will be designed / choreographed with a contemporary look at the history and culture of the land ""Anatolia"" which will be premiered in the near future.. ""On Life"" is a dance fed from the tempo of the daily life in NY.. It is aimed to abstract the whole verbal-ism in dance and create a sense of energy that's spent on obstacles people overcome -almost randomly- and the unexpected fast recovery they show in unexpected situations..    The physically and emotionally challenging rehearsal period started a couple weeks ago and we have been showing some parts of the movement phrases we've been working on which have received wonderful feedback form other dance professionals and audience.. With the ideas in my mind and with the respond I get from my dancer, with the unique vocabulary we build up together, the piece forms itself and slowly gets ready to meet the audience.    As working on establishing a professional company, the creative process, performance period and the post production costs money.. We need your support to be able to go on making new works, performing defined beauty and being able to share it with our audience. Dancers, rehearsal spaces, costumes, lighting and probably many more details that I cannot think of right now, can be made possible through your donations.. For this limited time, to be able to concentrate on the creative process, I need to raise a $2500 from the Kickstarter in a short period of time. You can donate starting from $1 and be a big support on our new steps..    Thank you for your Support,   Korhan Basaran",0,,0,0,USD,18,2550.0,2500.0,0 seconds,2011-05-25,2011-06-21,27,korhan basaran,"New York, NY",NA,418039702,18,2013-08-15,2010-11-08,8,3,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0
